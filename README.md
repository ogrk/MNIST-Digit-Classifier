# üßÆ MNIST Handwritten Digit Classifier Web App

An AI-powered web app that uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to recognize handwritten digits (0‚Äì9).  
Upload a clear image of a digit ‚Äî the app predicts which digit it is, instantly!

---

## ‚úÖ **What this project does**

- Loads a trained CNN model (`mnist_cnn_model.h5`) that recognizes digits based on the MNIST dataset.
- Lets a user upload a **28√ó28 pixel grayscale image** of a digit.
- Preprocesses the image: converts to grayscale, resizes, normalizes.
- Runs the CNN to predict the digit.
- Displays the prediction interactively in a Streamlit web interface.

## üîç **How it works ‚Äî Detailed**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Dataset:**  
   - Uses the classic **MNIST** dataset of handwritten digits (70,000 images of digits 0‚Äì9).

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Model:**  
   - Built using **TensorFlow/Keras**
   - Architecture:
     - 2 Convolutional layers to extract features.
     - MaxPooling layers to downsample.
     - Flatten + Dense layers for classification.
   - Trained for multiple epochs for high accuracy.
   - Saved as `mnist_cnn_model.h5`.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Web App:**  
   - Built with **Streamlit**.
   - Users upload an image.
   - The app:
     - Converts the image to grayscale.
     - Resizes it to 28√ó28 pixels.
     - Normalizes pixel values (0‚Äì1).
     - Predicts the digit using the loaded model.
   - Shows the uploaded image and the predicted digit.
